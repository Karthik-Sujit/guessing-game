# Guessing Game

Written in Rust, managed with Cargo

### A simple game of trial and error in the command line
### Pick a number between 0 and 100, (including both,) and enter it after being prompted
### The game responds with a `Too Large`, `Too Small` or a `You Win!` message.

### Adjust your next guess according to the response.

### Currently, the game goes on forever, until the number is guessed, or a KeyBoard Interrupt `(Ctrl+C)` is issued.
